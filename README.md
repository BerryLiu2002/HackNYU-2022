## Project Title: ExerSLICE

**Inspiration**<br>
Fitness is a goal that many strive for, but that few are able to successfully stick to. The problem stems from the difficulty of sticking to the routine, when it is so easy to simply... not do it.<br>
One solution that comes to mind is to make it more engaging- something that is indeed easier said than done. However one approach that has seen its fair share of success lies in geolocation games- the most memorable being Pokemon Go. <br>
The real appeal of the game is that its combines the more appealing gaming element of Pokemon with the beneficial effects of daily exercise. And it worked- Pokemon Go in Summer 2016, had everyone outside running around to catch Pokemon!<br>
For HackNYU 2022, our team wanted to leverage a gamelike design into a health and fitness tracking app. We decided to implement RPG-like elements into the app, where meeting your health goals would help you to fight monsters in the application. <br>
