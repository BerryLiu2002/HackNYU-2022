## Project Title: ExerSLICE

**Inspiration**<br>
Fitness is a goal that many strive for, but that few are able to successfully stick to. The problem stems from the difficulty of sticking to the routine, when it is so easy to simply... not do it.<br>
One solution that comes to mind is to make it more engaging- something that is indeed easier said than done. However one approach that has seen its fair share of success lies in geolocation games- the most memorable being Pokemon Go. <br>
The real appeal of the game is that its combines the more appealing gaming element of Pokemon with the beneficial effects of daily exercise. And it worked- Pokemon Go in Summer 2016, had everyone outside running around to catch Pokemon!<br>
For HackNYU 2022, our team wanted to leverage a gamelike design into a health and fitness tracking app. We decided to implement RPG-like elements into the app, where meeting your health goals would help you to fight monsters in the application. <br>

**What does ExerSLICE do?**<br>
ExerSLICE allows users to turn their healthy choices in real life into damage done in the application. Interaction in the game is done in two ways- keeping track of your eating goals, as well as exercising.<br>
Users are able to set a calorie goal- both for working out and eating. <br>
By completing workouts, users can enter their workout using the exercise button, and the Nutritionix natural language autocomplete search will decipher your workout and return calories burned through the exercise using a wide range of factors, including your age, weight, height, gender, etc. The burned calories will be dealt as damage to the monster, so the more calories you burn, the more justice you serve to the monsters! <br>
Meeting your dietary goals will also affect your progress in the app. As you input the food that you eat into the app, the calories you have consumed will be added to your food bar, and once surpassing your set limits, the excess calories will be given to the enemy as a shield.<br>
By giving you an in game visualization of your progress towards your goals, ExerSLICE gives you concrete proof of the effort you have been putting into improving your health and fitness! <br>
